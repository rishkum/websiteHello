      <description>Recently I got hold of a beta version of GitHub co-pilot. GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less work. GitHub Copilot draws context from comments and code, and suggests individual lines and whole functions instantly. GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, a new AI system created by OpenAI.
How good is it? According to Github: The model got their requests right about 43% of the time on the first try, and 57% of the time when allowed 10 attempts.</description>

      <description>no  Draft
Random forest algorithm helps us to classify items into various groupings.There are two kinds of random forest algorithms: one for regression and one for classifications. Both have similar underlying philosophies.
Before getting into random forest its important to know the workings of the Decision tree algorithm. It works in a way to find features that will split the data in resulting groups that are as different from each other and the members of th these groups are as similar to each other as possible.</description>
