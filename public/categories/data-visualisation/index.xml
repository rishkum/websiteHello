      <description>It has been 112 days since WHO declared the new Coronavirus epidemic as a pandemic. Since then we saw multiple countries imposing partial lockdowns to make people work from home more to completete shutdowns of their nations where people were only allowed to leave their homes for bare essestials.
Since then a lot has happened. There is a small hope that vaccines will be out soon and some european countries have started opening up their economies too.</description>

      <description>Over the past weeks I have had conversation with families and friends about coronavirus and about how different governments are responding to the challenge. One point that was mentioned often in the discussion was that its the countries with stronger government that have stayed off the crisis whereas democratic countries are the ones who cannot fight off the pandemic. Just because democracies make it slow.
I live in a democracy and believe in democracies ðŸ’• so I did find this idea a bit off-putting.</description>
