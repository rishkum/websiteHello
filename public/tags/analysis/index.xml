      <description>Recently I got hold of a beta version of GitHub co-pilot. GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less work. GitHub Copilot draws context from comments and code, and suggests individual lines and whole functions instantly. GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, a new AI system created by OpenAI.
It really feels quite magical to use. please see the gif below.</description>

      <description>It has been 112 days since WHO declared the new Coronavirus epidemic as a pandemic. Since then we saw multiple countries imposing partial lockdowns to make people work from home more to completete shutdowns of their nations where people were only allowed to leave their homes for bare essestials.
Since then a lot has happened. There is a small hope that vaccines will be out soon and some european countries have started opening up their economies too.</description>
