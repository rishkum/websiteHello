      <description>no  Random forest algorithm helps us to classify items into various groupings.There are two kinds of random forest algorithms: one for regressiona and one for clasifications. Both have similar underlying philosophies.
Before getting into random forest its important to know the workings of the Decision tree algorithm. It works in a way to find features that will split the data in resulting groups that are as different from each other and the memebers of th these groups are as similar to each other as possible.</description>

      <description>It has been 112 days since WHO declared the new Coronavirus epidemic as a pandemic. Since then we saw multiple countries imposing partial lockdowns to make people work from home more to completete shutdowns of their nations where people were only allowed to leave their homes for bare essestials.
Since then a lot has happened. There is a small hope that vaccines will be out soon and some european countries have started opening up their economies too.</description>
